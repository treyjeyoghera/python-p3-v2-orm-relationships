# Mapping Object Relationships : Code-Along

## Learning Goals

- Implement ORM methods to manage a one-to-many relationship between classes.

---

## Key Vocab

- **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**: a programming technique that provides a
  mapping between an object-oriented data model and a relational database model.

---

## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll implement a one-to-many relationship between departments
and employees:

- An employee works in one department.
- A department has many employees.

Let's assume each employee works for exactly one department. The relationship
represents composition since an employee must be associated with a department.

## Code Along

This lesson is a code-along, so fork and clone the repo.

**NOTE: Remember to run `pipenv install` to install the dependencies and
`pipenv shell` to enter your virtual environment before running your code.**

```bash
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

The `lib` folder contains starter code for the `Department` and `Employee`
classes. Both classes include ORM methods for mapping the individual class to a
corresponding table in the database:

| Python Class | Relational Database Table |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| Department   | departments               |
| Employee     | employees                 |

The one-to-many relationship between `Department` and `Employee` is **not**
implemented in the starter code. In this lesson, we will:

- Update the `Employee` class to add a new attribute to model the one-to-many
  relationship.
- Update the `Employee` class methods to store and manage the relationship in
  the "employees" database.
- Update the `Department` class to add a new method to **compute** (not store) a
  list of associated `Employee` instances.

---

## Mapping a one-to-many relationship

The concept of **single source of truth** states we should design our software
and data to avoid redundancy. In terms of relational database design, we want to
store the relationship between two entities in just one place within the
database. We do this to avoid issues that often arise when redundant data is not
updated in a consistent manner.

When we have a relationship between two classes, we need to figure out where to
store the relationship. For the one-to-many relationship, the class (or entity)
on the "many" side is the owner of the relationship and is responsible for
storing the relationship. Why? Beside each object on the "many" side (i.e.
Employee) is related to just one entity on the "one" side (i.e. Department),
thus each employee only needs to store a single value to maintain the
relationship with its department.

![owning side](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/7134/python-p3-v2-orm/owning_side.png)

`Employee` is on the many side of the relationship, thus it **owns** and manages
the relationship by storing a single piece of data about the associated
`Department`.

- The "Employee" class will have an attribute `department_id` to reference the
  id of the associated `Department` object.
- The "employees" table will contain a column `department_id` to store a foreign
  key reference to the "departments" table.

`Department` is on the "one" side of the relationship, thus it should not
**store** a list of the associated `Employee` instances. Instead, a list of the
many `Employee` objects associated with the department will be **computed** by
looking at the `department_id` foreign key value stored with each employee.

---

## Updating the `Employee` class to store the relationship

Let's update the `Employee` class to store the relationship to `Department` by
making the following changes:

- Import the `Department` class.
- Update the `__init__` method to add a parameter `department_id` and store the
  value in a new attribute with the same name.
- Update the `__repr__` method to include the value of the new attribute.

```py
from __init__ import CURSOR, CONN
from department import Department


class Employee:

    # Dictionary of objects saved to the database.
    all = {}

    def __init__(self, name, job_title, department_id, id=None):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.job_title = job_title
        self.department_id = department_id

    def __repr__(self):
        return (
            f"<Employee {self.id}: {self.name}, {self.job_title}, " +
            f"Department ID: {self.department_id}>"
        )

    # existing ORM methods ...
```

Next, we'll update the `create_table` method to add a column named
`department_id` to store the relationship as a foreign key in the "employees"
table:

```py
@classmethod
def create_table(cls):
    """ Create a new table to persist the attributes of Employee instances """
    sql = """
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        name TEXT,
        job_title TEXT,
        department_id INTEGER,
        FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(id))
    """
    CURSOR.execute(sql)
    CONN.commit()
```

We need up adapt the `save`, `update`, and `create` methods to persist the new
relationship by storing the department id in the "employees" table:

```py
def save(self):
        """ Insert a new row with the name, job title, and department id values of the current Employee object.
        Update object id attribute using the primary key value of new row.
        Save the object in local dictionary using table row's PK as dictionary key"""
        sql = """
                INSERT INTO employees (name, job_title, department_id)
                VALUES (?, ?, ?)
        """

        CURSOR.execute(sql, (self.name, self.job_title, self.department_id))
        CONN.commit()

        self.id = CURSOR.lastrowid
        type(self).all[self.id] = self

    def update(self):
        """Update the table row corresponding to the current Employee object."""
        sql = """
            UPDATE employees
            SET name = ?, job_title = ?, department_id = ?
            WHERE id = ?
        """
        CURSOR.execute(sql, (self.name, self.job_title,
                             self.department_id, self.id))
        CONN.commit()

    @classmethod
    def create(cls, name, job_title, department_id):
        """ Initialize a new Employee object and save the object to the database """
        employee = cls(name, job_title, department_id)
        employee.save()
        return employee

```

The final change to the `Employee` class is to update the `instance_from_db`
method to include the department id from the table row.

```py
@classmethod
def instance_from_db(cls, row):
    """Return an Employee object having the attribute values from the table row."""

    # Check the dictionary for  existing instance using the row's primary key
    employee = cls.all.get(row[0])
    if employee:
        # ensure attributes match row values in case local instance was modified
        employee.name = row[1]
        employee.job_title = row[2]
        employee.department_id = row[3]
    else:
        # not in dictionary, create new instance and add to dictionary
        employee = cls(row[1], row[2], row[3])
        employee.id = row[0]
        cls.all[employee.id] = employee
    return employee
```

## Updating the `Department` class to compute associated `Employee` instances

Since `Department` is not on the owning side of the relationship, we won't store
anything about employees in the "departments" table. But we might want to get a
list of all employees that work for a department. We'll add a method to the
`Department` class that accomplishes this task:

- query the "employees" table for rows that contain a foreign key value that
  matches the current department's id.
- map the row data to an `Employee` instance.

Note that we import the `Employee` class within the function definition to
issues with circular imports (since the `Employee` class imports the
`Department` class as well).

```py
from __init__ import CURSOR, CONN

class Department:

    # existing attributes and methods ...

    def employees(self):
        """Return list of employees associated with current department"""
        from employee import Employee
        sql = """
            SELECT * FROM employees
            WHERE department_id = ?
        """
        CURSOR.execute(sql, (self.id,),)

        rows = CURSOR.fetchall()
        return [
            Employee.instance_from_db(row) for row in rows
        ]
```

## Exploring the one-to-many relationship

The file `lib/debug.py` has been updated to initialize the database with two
departments and several employees. The code generates fake names for the
employees, and picks a random job title and department for each employee.

Run the file to recreate the database with sample data:

```bash
python lib/debug.py
```

In the `ipdb` session, you can explore the table data using the ORM methods:

```py
ipdb> Department.get_all()
[<Department 1: Payroll, Building A, 5th Floor>, <Department 2: Human Resources, Building C, East Wing>]
```

```py
ipdb> Employee.get_all()
[<Employee 1: Amir, Accountant, Department ID: 1>, <Employee 2: Bola, Manager, Department ID: 1>, <Employee 3: Charlie, Manager, Department ID: 2>, <Employee 4: Dani, Benefits Coordinator, Department ID: 2>, <Employee 5: Hao, New Hires Coordinator, Department ID: 2>]
```

An employee works in one department. Let's get the first employee:

```py
ipdb> employee = Employee.find_by_id(1)
ipdb> employee
<Employee 1: Amir, Accountant, Department ID: 1>

We can use the employee `department_id` value to get the single associated `Department` instance:

ipdb> Department.find_by_id(employee.department_id)
<Department 1: Payroll, Building A, 5th Floor>
```

A department may have many employees. Let's select the payroll department:

```py
ipdb> payroll = Department.find_by_id(1)
ipdb> payroll
<Department 1: Payroll, Building A, 5th Floor>
```

We can call the `employees()` method to get the list of employees that work in
the payroll department.

```py
ipdb> payroll.employees()
[<Employee 1: Amir, Accountant, Department ID: 1>, <Employee 2: Bola, Manager, Department ID: 1>]
```

You can also use the SQLITE EXPLORER to view the relationship.

## Testing the `Employee` and `Department` classes

The `lib/testing` folder contains the files `department_orm_test.py` and
`employee_orm_test.py` to test the `Department` and `Employee` classes. Run the
tests and confirm they pass:

```bash
pytest -x
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson we've seen how to persist a one-to-many relationship between
classes. The class or entity on the "many" side of the relationship is
responsible for storing and maintaining the relationship, since it only needs to
store a single value to reference the associated object/entity on the "one"
side.
